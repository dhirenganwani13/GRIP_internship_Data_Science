This repository contains codes and information about the tasks which I was assigned by GRIP foundation as my internship tasks. 
My project domain is 'Data Science and Business Analytics tasks'.

In this, a dataset containing Hours and scores was provided and the task was to predict the score of a student based on the number of hours he studies.
